# GPSVelo

This Java program was written for my 2007 Ducati Motorcycle. The speedometer reads in kph and is irritating to keep up with the conversions. I wrote this program to use
GPS coordinates to provide accurate MPH to the driver of the motorcycle. Simply open the app and it will begin displaying MPH on your screen.
